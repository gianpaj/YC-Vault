# Project Vision

## Vision
I vision YC Vault to be the number one place for people to analyse the YCombinator directory.

YCombinator is a living database that capture more attention as more data is collected over time.
YC Vault's vision is that turning VC startup directories will be as easy as riding a bike.

Over the last decade, we've seen the importance of AI, the increase of data-driven decision making, and the reliance of technology ever so growing.
These trends are set to acceleralte rapidly, now that language models are becoming a household product.

Imagine if you were able to analyze a VC's investment portfolio with just a single piece of software.
We'll actually be able to do this as soon as we build a user experience that blows competition away.
Eventually, we will elimiate the need for VC analysts and large data pipelines for users to manage.

## Mission
I want nextjs app that provides visualizations of the performance of each ycombinator batch over time.
I want to be able to use it to make data-driven decisions as a VC partner or a founder.

## Core Values
- Data is King
- Shoot for Saturn  
- Archive for the future
- Anything is possible
