# YC Analyzed
 Analysis on every YC Batch ever.
 Read the initial blog post [here.](https://lukafilipovic.com/writing/2024/10/12/analysing-every-y-combinator-batch-ever/)

 ## Why?
Exceptional founders deliver exceptional results. Y Combinator has one of the highest concentrations of technical founders.
Companies like Airbnb, Docker, Instacart and Coinbase were all brought up through the accelerator. But they only represent the top percentile. 
That's why I built YC Analyzed.

## Requirements
Any language model of your choice through LiteLLM. High-performing models like GPT-4o-mini are recommended for their data extraction accuracy.

## Scraping the data yourself...
```
git clone https://github.com/lukafilipxvic/YC-Analyzed.git
```
1. Set your ```.env``` file with the required API keys.
2. Install dependencies with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```.
3. Run ```run_yc_pipeline.py``` to scrape all the URLs into YC_URLs.csv

## Time to Complate
```get_yc_urls.py``` takes 5:20 minutes to scrape all YC urls.

```get_yc_data.py``` takes 3 seconds to run for one company, taking 4.17 hours to scrape 5,000 YC companies synchronously.

## Cost to Scrape
```get_yc_data.py``` with GPT-4o-mini costs â‰ˆ $0.00111 per YC company page, costing approximately $5.56 to scrape 5,000 YC companies.

In comparison, Gumloop charges 5 tokens to use a web-scraper and GPT-4o-mini twice, costing $80.83 to scrape 5,000 YC companies.

The project is 14.5x cheaper then Gumloop...
