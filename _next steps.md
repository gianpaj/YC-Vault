# Next Steps

## Create run_pipeline.py
### Create working environment using the current date
Why - To easily scrape and analyze YC data overtime.

### Edit generate_statistics.py
Make it return in a meaningful way for people to use on social media.

### Edit Generate_charts.py
I also use Excel to generate the charts manually. Let's migrate to use pivot tables from Mito.
